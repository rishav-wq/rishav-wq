# 🚀 Projects:
## **MRI Tumor Detector (Present)**
- Developed a **deep learning-based MRI tumor detection system** using **VGG16 transfer learning**.
- Built and trained the model using **TensorFlow/Keras**, achieving high accuracy.
- Preprocessed MRI images using **PIL and ImageEnhance** for improved model performance.
- Created a **Flask-based web application** for image upload and **tumor detection with confidence scores**.
- Optimized the model with **fine-tuned VGG16 and image augmentation techniques**.
- Utilized **Computer Vision techniques** to detect and classify tumor regions.

## **Medicine Recommendation System (Present)**
- Built a **Flask-based web app** that recommends **medications, diets, and precautions** based on symptoms.
- Used **scikit-learn** to train ML models for **disease prediction and treatment recommendations**.
- Implemented **data manipulation and analysis** using **Pandas and NumPy**.
- Designed an **intuitive, user-friendly interface** for symptom-based recommendations.

## **BuzzChat (Present)**
- Developed a **real-time chat application** using **Firebase Realtime Database**.
- Implemented **user authentication and real-time updates**
